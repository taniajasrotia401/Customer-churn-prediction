# Customer Churn Prediction â€“ Telco Dataset

This project focuses on predicting whether a telecom customer is likely to churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior, contract types, and service usage, the model helps identify high-risk customers for proactive retention efforts.

The workflow includes:

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Exploratory data analysis and visualizations
- Machine learning using Random Forest
- Estimating business impact by calculating potential revenue retained

A key aspect of this project is its connection between model predictions and real-world financial outcomes, making the analysis actionable for business decision-makers.
